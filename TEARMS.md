## 1. Attribution Requirement

By using, copying, or significantly modifying this repository **TPCfree**, you automatically agree to the following binding terms:

If **your project includes 82% or more** of the code, logic, or structure from this repository — whether modified or not — you are **required to provide visible attribution** in the public description of your bot on any and all listing platforms (such as top.gg, discord.bots.gg, etc.).

The attribution must include the following text (or equivalent meaning):

> "This project includes a significant portion of code from the [TPC BOT repository](https://github.com/IliaPiasta/TPCfree/)."

- This text may appear in small font or footnote, but it must be **publicly visible**.
- Omitting or hiding the attribution is considered a **violation of these terms**.

## Enforcement

These terms become **automatically effective immediately** upon use, fork, or integration of the code.  
No further agreement or approval is required.

In the case of a violation:
- A formal takedown request (DMCA or otherwise) may be filed against your listing or repository.
- You may be banned or blocked from official support services and future access to updates or collaborations.

These conditions are set to **protect the original authorship** and maintain fairness in the open-source community.
